# Clean up modifier RE to match current ABNF.  Added test example for this.
# Fixed missing space in one test/example.
#
# Revision 1.39  2005/07/28 03:56:13  kitterma
# Restore three part API (res, code, txt).
# Add dictionary to support local policy checks in future updates.
# Add record for trusted-forwarder.org - support future TFWL checks.
#
# Revision 1.38  2005/07/26 14:11:12  kitterma
# Added check to PermError if SPF record has no spaces
#
# Revision 1.37  2005/07/26 06:12:19  customdesigned
# Use ABNF derived RE for IP4.  IP6 RE is way ugly...
#
# Revision 1.36  2005/07/26 05:59:38  customdesigned
# Validate ip4 address format.
#
# Revision 1.35  2005/07/26 05:23:24  customdesigned
# Fix stupid typo in RE_CIDR
#
# Revision 1.34  2005/07/23 17:58:02  customdesigned
# Put new result codes in unit tests.
#
# Revision 1.33  2005/07/22 18:23:28  kitterma
# *** Breaks external API.  Only returns SPF result now.  Up to the calling
# module to determine the MTA result codes from that.  Also, internally support
# the newer PermError/TempError convention.
#
# Revision 1.32  2005/07/22 17:45:20  kitterma
# Converted TempError to look like PermError processing
#
# Revision 1.31  2005/07/22 02:11:50  customdesigned
# Use dictionary to check for CNAME loops.  Check limit independently for
# each top level name, just like for PTR.
#
# Revision 1.30  2005/07/21 20:07:31  customdesigned
# Translate DNS error in DNSLookup.  This completely isolates DNS
# dependencies to the DNSLookup method.
#
# Revision 1.29  2005/07/21 17:49:39  customdesigned
# My best guess at what RFC intended for limiting CNAME loops.
#
# Revision 1.28  2005/07/21 17:37:08  customdesigned
# Break out external DNSLookup method so that test suite can
# duplicate CNAME loop bug.  Test zone data dictionary now
# mirrors structure of real DNS.
#
# Revision 1.27  2005/07/21 15:26:06  customdesigned
# First cut at updating docs.  Test suite is obsolete.

# encountered during evaluation.
#
# Revision 1.25  2005/07/19 23:24:42  customdesigned
# Validate all mechanisms before evaluating.
#
# Revision 1.24  2005/07/19 18:11:52  kitterma
# Fix to change that compares type TXT and type SPF records.  Bug in the change
# prevented records from being returned if it was published as TXT, but not SPF.
#
# Revision 1.23  2005/07/19 15:22:50  customdesigned
# MX and PTR limits are MUST NOT check limits, and do not result in PermErr.
# Also, check belongs in mx and ptr specific methods, not in dns() method.
#
# Revision 1.22  2005/07/19 05:02:29  customdesigned
# FQDN test was broken.  Added test case.  Move FQDN test to after
# macro expansion.
#

# TXT record is found and make sure if type SPF is present that they are
# identical when using strict processing.
#
# Revision 1.19  2005/07/18 19:36:00  kitterma
# Change to require at least one dot in a domain name.  Added PermError
# description to indicate FQDN should be used.  This is a common error.
#
# Revision 1.18  2005/07/18 17:13:37  kitterma
# Change macro processing to raise PermError on an unknown macro.
# schlitt-spf-classic-02 para 8.1.  Change exp modifier processing to ignore
# exp strings with syntax errors.  schlitt-spf-classic-02 para 6.2.
#

# Recursion limit raises AssertionError in strict mode, PermError otherwise.
#
# Revision 1.14  2005/07/15 20:34:11  customdesigned
# Check whether DNS package already supports SPF before patching
#

#
# Revision 1.9  2005/07/15 03:33:14  kitterma
# Fix for bug 1238403 - Crash if non-CIDR / present.  Also added
# validation check for valid IPv4 CIDR range.
#
# Revision 1.8  2005/07/14 04:18:01  customdesigned
# Bring explanations and Received-SPF header into line with
# the unknown=PermErr and error=TempErr convention.
# Hope my case-sensitive mech fix doesn't clash with Scotts.
#
# Revision 1.7  2005/07/12 21:43:56  kitterma
# Added processing to clarify some cases of unknown
# qualifier errors (to distinguish between unknown qualifier and
# unknown mechanism).
# Also cleaned up comments from previous updates.

# Changes from draft-mengwong overall DNS lookup and recursion
# depth limits to draft-schlitt-spf-classic-02 DNS lookup, MX lookup, and
# PTR lookup limits.  Recursion code is still present and functioning, but
# it should be impossible to trip it.
#
# Revision 1.2  2005/06/21 16:46:09  kitterma
# Updated definition of SPF, added reference to the sourceforge project site,

#   18-dec-2003, v1.6, Failures on Intel hardware: endianness.  Use ! on
